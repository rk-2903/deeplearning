{"_id": "74", "question": "Psoriasis for past 7-8 years I had psoriasis on my scalp for nearly 10 years. Please give suggestions and medications.", "reference": "Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical psoriasis treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis include corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares; creams or solutions containing vitamin D; anthralin to slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation, but also increase sensitivity to sunlight, which requires applying sunscreen before going outdoors. Calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.  Salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. Coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. It is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils.  Coal tar can irritate the skin, has a strong odor and stains clothing and bedding.  Light therapy (phototherapy) uses natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.  Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment.  Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light.   For severe psoriasis or psoriasis resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. These drugs include retinoids; methotrexate (Rheumatrex) that helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation; cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) that suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term.  Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics) include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections.  Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given.  A number of alternative therapies to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs, are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling.  Alternative therapies include aloe vera that may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation; fish oil to reduce inflammation. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. Oregon grape (barberry) may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms.  Other measures that may help include daily baths to remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. Use moisturizer. Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. Avoid drinking alcohol.  If you do drink, keep it moderate.", "prediction": "Psoriasis on scalp for past 7-8 years Please give suggestions and medications."}

It is important for all pregnant women to start prenatal care early and continue it through the pregnancy. Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy. Other factors that can increase a woman's risk include chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy, obesity, age  over 40, being pregnant with more than one fetus, African American ethnicity, family history of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, urinary tract infections, gum disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease. Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization. If you are at very high risk of preeclampsia, your doctor may recommend that you start taking low-dose aspirin after at least 12 weeks of pregnancy. Visit your health care provider for a preconception visit to discuss what you can do to lower your risk. Your health care provider may recommend ways to control your blood pressure, if needed, by limiting your salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight. If you take medication to control your blood pressure, ask your health care provider if you should change it. Some medications should not be used during pregnancy. Get regular prenatal care, including regular blood pressure checks, urine tests for protein, as well as regular weight checks. Avoid alcohol and tobacco.

Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills.  Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which are inherited in an X-linked recessive  pattern. DMD may also occur in people who do not have a family history of the disease.  The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants.

Adults may have open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma or secondary glaucoma.  Open-angle glaucoma occurs due to slow increase in eye pressure over time, and is the most common type of glaucoma. Its cause is unknown, but it tends to run in the families. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs due to a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.  Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: drugs such as corticosteroids, eye diseases such as uveitis, diabetes, eye injury. Most people cannot feel open-angle glaucoma. People may experience blind spots and slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision). Symptoms of closed-angle glaucoma may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: sudden, severe pain in one eye decreased or cloudy vision, nausea and vomiting, rainbow-like halos around lights, red eye, feeling that an eye is swollen. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam. You will be given a test to check your eye pressure (tonometry.)  Eye pressure can be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include: using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy), optic nerve imaging, checking your visual acuity, field of vision, retina and how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response), 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.  If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops. You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye. If drops alone do not work, you may need laser treatment that uses a painless laser to open the channels for fluid  to flow out.  If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure. Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery. An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, your doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent an attack in that eye.You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated. You may be given drops, pills, and IV medicine to lower your eye pressure. Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy.  If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions.  You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma, but you can help prevent vision loss. A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat. All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40. You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider. If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss.", "prediction": "Glaucoma is the most common form of cancer that affects the brain and spinal cord.
