        "The ROUGE metric scores you obtained indicate moderate summarization quality with a strong leaning toward recall:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recall is relatively high (ROUGE-1: 0.714, ROUGE-2: 0.462, ROUGE-L: 0.571)**, meaning the generated summary covers a good portion of the important content from the reference. This suggests your model or method captures relevant information well.\n",
        "- **Precision values are noticeably lower (ROUGE-1: 0.182, ROUGE-2: 0.111, ROUGE-L: 0.145)**, implying the generated summaries include extra or less relevant words that don't match the reference closely. This is common when models over-generate or are less concise.\n",
        "- **F-measure balances the two (ROUGE-1: 0.29, ROUGE-2: 0.179, ROUGE-L: 0.232)** showing an overall moderate overlap quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary Explanation\n",
        "Your summarization system is effective at covering key content but tends toward verbosity or including noisy information, lowering precision. ROUGE-1 scores are higher than ROUGE-2 as unigram overlaps are easier than exact bigram matches, indicating fluency improvements are needed.\n",

        "To improve the model, consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enhance Precision:**\n",
        "   - Integrate better content selection techniques, e.g., attention mechanisms focusing on the most relevant sentences.\n",
        "   - Apply post-processing to remove redundant or irrelevant parts.\n",
        "2. **Better Fluency:**\n",
        "   - Use more advanced abstractive models such as pretrained transformers fine-tuned for medical text summarization.\n",
        "   - Apply reinforcement learning or coverage mechanisms to avoid repetition and improve coherence.\n",
        "3. **Multi-metric Optimization:**\n",
        "   - Balance precision and recall through model loss functions designed to optimize F-measure directly.\n",
        "4. **Data Quality:**\n",
        "   - Review and clean training summaries to reduce noise.\n",
        "   - Augment dataset with more diverse and high-quality clinical summaries.\n",
        "5. **Human Evaluation:**\n",
        "   - Supplement automatic metrics with expert reviews to guide model refinement focusing on clinical relevance and clarity."
